👋 Hi, I’m @christianyarwood62
Im studying in my free time to expand my knowledge of Software Development

I graduated from the University of Southampton in MEng Mechanical Engineering, achieving a 1st class degree.

In university, I learned Python and Matlab and loved it. I joined an engineering graduate scheme out of university and decided to learn Javascript in my free time to develop web applications. I used my free time to undertake Udemy courses, but mainly using javascript documentation to learn. I then progressed to learning React, mainly by undertaking personal projects, to further my knowledge of web applications while using the React Library to optimise the application building process.
